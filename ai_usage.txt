What AI tool did you use?
    OpenAI's o3-mini model

How did you use it? What kind of questions did you ask? (include links to your conversation if applicable)
    Used OpenAI's o3-mini model to assist in key decision making for mongoDB database architecture, learning how to make a side loading modal, and how to structure the POST and DELETE routes in the backend. No links available due to it being integrated into VSCode. 

How much did it help you? How helpful and accurate was it?
    It was very useful and pretty suprisingly accurate as it was able to conetextualize my questions with the codebase it had access to.
